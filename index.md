### Welcome to My Portfolio
Everything here can be reached from my [GitHub](https://github.com/BrendenLatham), but feel free to use this to brows my work.

### About
I am a Junior computer science student attending East Central University in Ada Ok. Computer science is my prefered field, but my real passions lie on the mathematicaly heavier side of the subject. My two favorite topics are Probability and Graph Theory. Most of my work thus far has been done in data processing, interpretation, and visualization.
